The TURRET Module.

Current run file includes direction of Pan and Tilt servos by generating random positions in the method and passing them to the horizontal ( Pan servo ) and vertical ( tilt servo ) planes. We can also think of these as cartesian points with the tilt on the y axix and the pan on the x axis. This assembly could indeed be controlled on said x and y axis with a joystick and it's inputs. Methods to control the pan and tilt by following an object are to follow making a true sentry device.'

For now, a laser diode is mounted to the top of the tilt servo and a buzzer has been synced to each laser "blink" for maximum death ray effect.

The Turret module will be acivated via IR signal or WiFi in the future and then, no one will pass.
